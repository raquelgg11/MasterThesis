# MasterThesis
This repository contains several files developed for my Master's thesis. 

`.dat` files have been compressed using **Pickle** module.

`LS-MM-MT.dat` contains Synthetic Lethalities identified for Multiple Myeloma model, followed by distinct Metabolic Tasks in which they are involved. 

`LS-blood-MT.dat` has the same information, but for blood model. 

`LS-human1-MT.dat` has the same information, but for Human1. 

`SGD-MM.dat` contains essential genes identified for Multiple Myeloma model, followed by distinct Metabolic Tasks in which they are involved. 

`SGD-blood.dat` has the same information, but for blood model. 

`SGD-human.dat` has the same information, but for Human1. 

`generating57models.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook script which generate models able to perform each of the 57 Metabolic Tasks.
